# Introduction to openFrameworks (Part 1)


[openFrameworks](openframeworks.cc) is an open source C++ library for creative coding. Similar to Processing, openFrameworks allows users to quickly and easily (sometimes) create graphics-driven applications.

## Why use openFrameworks?

One of the biggest advantages of openFrameworks is its extremely active community. Because it is opensource, many people contribute to the openFrameworks code base. There are also many people contributing libraries (called 'addons' in the oF community) that extend oF's core capabilities. All addons are catalogued on ofxAddons.com](http://ofxaddons.com/categories) and cover a huge variety of topics. Some addons are completely new code, while others wrap other useful libraries. Here's a sampling of the most popular:

* [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) Requires ofxCv. Detects faces and tracks the positions, orientations, and scales of key facial features (eyes, nostrils, jaw, etc.)
* [ofxDarknet](https://github.com/mrzl/ofxDarknet) A neural network addon for openFrameworks. Comes with pre-trained models and samples to try out fun neural network techniques.
* [ofxMidi](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi) Provides MIDI I/O capability to an oF app. 
* [ofxAudioAnalyzer](https://github.com/leozimmerman/ofxAudioAnalyzer)
* [ofxFilterLibrary](https://github.com/mfargo/ofxFilterLibrary) A set of graphical filter examples that use GLSL shaders.

Caveats: Not all addons are maintained, and some may become incompatible with later releases of openFrameworks. You also cannot guarantee the quality (or functionality) or any library. Have fun, but know the risks. 

### openFrameworks vs. Processing 

For many of our workshops, we've been using tools like p5.js, Processing, and Javascript. OpenFrameworks is a C++-based library that can be more challenging to adapt to. That said, it can be well suited for more complex projects that require performance and speed. It's also great if you want to leverage the existing libraries.


Processing (or p5.js) is excellent for quick software prototypes. It's easy to throw some code in, experiment, and see the result. Processing is not usually suited for professional-level installations or more permanent pieces. Processing can be much slower than openFrameworks, depending on what you're doing. With p5.js, you can easily publish projects to the web.

openFrameworks has a very strong community of contributors. 

## Setup

For this workshop, download a zip of the latest [openFrameworks release](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) (0.9.8). You can also clone the openframeworks repository directly from Github, but the zip file comes with a prebuilt project generator, which can be used to create a new project. 


### Clone the Code Kitchen repository


After downloading the openFrameworks release, navigate to openFrameworks/apps and clone or download this repository. To clone from a terminal, use the following commands:

```javascript
cd of_v0.9.8_osx_release/apps
git clone https://github.com/codekitchensd/2017-08-17-intro-to-openframeworks.git
```

### (Option) Create your own project with the Project Generator

To build a new project in openFrameworks, it's easiest to use the Project Generator tool. This ensures that your application knows where all of the openFrameworks source files are. You have the option of including additional ofxAddons using the project generator as well.

### Open your app and build openFrameworks

Unlike processing, you can't simply hit the play button. To build and run an openFrameworks application, you must first build openFrameworks itself.
